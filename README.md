Hi, I’m Pranay — a Java/J2EE full-stack engineer focused on building production-grade systems end to end: Spring Boot microservices, MySQL-backed APIs, and ReactJS UIs, with strong attention to performance, clean architecture, and maintainability. [conversation_history:1]  
I ship with engineering rigor—automated testing (JUnit), CI/CD (Jenkins), and cloud-native delivery using Docker, Kubernetes, and AWS—while collaborating effectively in Agile/SAFe workflows via Jira. [conversation_history:1]
